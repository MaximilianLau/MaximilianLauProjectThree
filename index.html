<!-- 1.1 A Simple Take-Away Game. Here are the rules of a very simple impartial
combinatorial game of removing chips from a pile of chips.
(1) There are two players. We label them I and II.
(2) There is a pile of 21 chips in the center of a table.
(3) A move consists of removing one, two, or three chips from the pile. At least one
chip must be removed, but no more than three may be removed.
(4) Players alternate moves with Player I starting.
(5) The player that removes the last chip wins. (The last player to move wins. If you
can’t move, you lose.)
How can we analyze this game? Can one of the players force a win in this game?
Which player would you rather be, the player who starts or the player who goes second?
What is a good strategy?
We analyze this game from the end back to the beginning. This method is sometimes
called backward induction.
I–3
If there are just one, two, or three chips left, the player who moves next wins
simply by taking all the chips.
Suppose there are four chips left. Then the player who moves next must
leave either one, two or three chips in the pile and his opponent will be able to
win. So four chips left is a loss for the next player to move and a win for the
previous player, i.e. the one who just moved.
With 5, 6, or 7 chips left, the player who moves next can win by moving to
the position with four chips left.
With 8 chips left, the next player to move must leave 5, 6, or 7 chips, and so
the previous player can win.
We see that positions with 0, 4, 8, 12, 16,... chips are target positions; we
would like to move into them. We may now analyze the game with 21 chips.
Since 21 is not divisible by 4, the first player to move can win. The unique
optimal move is to take one chip and leave 20 chips which is a target position. -->
